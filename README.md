- **External Data**
    
    Automatically create a new DocType with its data structure of a file
    
    Allows you to select the Module of a Frappe application in which you will create the DocType
    
    Supports files with formats: Excel, CSV, JSON and XML
    
    Analyze the data set to determine the type of data that fields are mandatory and lists of selectable values
    
    Allows successive data loads, provided that the format of the file and the position of the data match the original file used to create the DocType
    
    
    It is limited to data structures of simple records without tables. This version does not load a JSON or XML with hierarchized data in several levels.    

- **Redash**

    Integrate the view of dashboards in Frappe so that end users do not need to access Redash
    
    Provides a security layer that allows Frappe to manage user access to control panels according to their roles

    It is not the purpose of this connector to allow the definition of new Redash panels from Frappe. The system administrator or an expert BI technician should define directly in Redash the control panels that will be visible by this connector in this new module.
